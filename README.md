Hello guys, here's Littlepip. Sure it's my nickname, now I'm .NET backend developer, and I'm interested in lots of things such as Language learning, desiging,
3D Modeling animation and computer science, most of them is C#, although a bit of python and javascript.(My professional skill is not so far, so that I ain't a pro but I keep 
 learning.)  
With my language skill, My mother language is Chinese (Mandarin), English and a bit Germany and currently I'am learning it. Those projects I published
are most ideas and practise I have had. 
I haven't been not in IT industry for long cause my master major is about machanic, most of IT skills I have relies on my self-study, but finaly I got an IT job to develop .NET 
web that I can keep learning.
